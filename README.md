# [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Scrolling Nav](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

[Scrolling Nav](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/) is an unstyled one page starter template with a collapsing, smooth scrolling navigation bar for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) integration for easy, seamless development.

## Getting Started

To use this template:
* Fork this repository on GitHub
* Install the node dependencies: ```npm install```
* Next, install the bower dependencies: ```bower install```
* Ensure you have a global version of Gulp installed: ```gulp -v``` the output should look something like this (note the ```CLI version```):

```Shell
[14:48:27] CLI version 3.9.0
[14:48:27] Local version 3.9.0
```
If you don't have gulp installed globally, you can install it with ```npm install -g gulp```
* This project uses [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/). You'll need to have it installed for the livereload integration in Gulp. I recommend the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei).
* Finally, run ```gulp``` to build the project and have it open in your browser window. If for whatever reason the browser window doesn't open automatically, navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser to view the site. Changes should be reflected instantly thanks to LiveReload.
